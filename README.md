# Introduction

Welcome to the Jenkins Blue Ocean Pipeline microservice.  This project should be used to start as the basis to your
Blue Ocean pipeline system.  This microservice is based off the [Jenkins Extended Shared Library](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/)
solution.  It also includes core Groovy scripts that are useful for anyone trying to setup a Blue Ocean pipeline.


# Questions and issues

The [github issue tracker](https://github.com/AnthonyL22/pipeline-microservice/issues) is **_only_** for bug reports and
feature requests. Anything else, such as questions for help in using the library, should be [emailed to our team](http://www.pacificwebconsulting.com/contact/).
